In this task, you are expected to train a Machine Learning model that classifies a given line in the data file as belonging to one of the following 12 literary novels:

0: alice_in_wonderland
1: dracula
2: dubliners
3: great_expectations
4: hard_times
5: huckleberry_finn
6: les_miserable
7: moby_dick
8: oliver_twist
9: peter_pan
10: tale_of_two_cities
11: tom_sawyer


Description:

You are provided with a zip file (ml_task.zip) containing three text files - xtrain_obfuscated.txt, ytrain.txt, xtest_obfuscated.txt. Each line in the x files comes from a different novel. The data has been obfuscated, however the patterns in them are preserved. The novel ids corresponding to xtrain_obfuscated.txt are specified in ytrain.txt. You can use these labels to train a model (Deep Learning preferred).

With the learned model, predict the novel ids of the lines in xtest.txt (one prediction per line). 

Please present your solution as a jupyter notebook (or similar) that has all your code side by side with text explanations of your steps and the ideas behind the approach you have taken. Be sure to include:

* A brief EDA
* Your predictions in a file named ytest.txt (in the same format as ytrain.txt)
* Expected accuracy on the test set.

We think this task would take between 3-5 hours, depending on your experience. Be mindful of this before starting the task. If you can see that it will take you much longer than this, consider this as a sign that you may not be well-suited to the role being offered here. Your time may be better spent on preparing for an alternative position.
